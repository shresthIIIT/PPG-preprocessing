The following codes are matlab function you can use in your main matlab program for removal of noise from PPG signals as an initial preprocessing step.
(By simply using y=preprocess(your_signal_variable_name, sampling_frequency);
It is one of the robust approach using wavelet transform which effectively filter the PPG signals and maintains its clinically relevant information.
